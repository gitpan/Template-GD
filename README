NAME
    Template::Plugin::GD - GD plugin(s) for the Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        [% USE GD;
     
           # create an image
           img = GD.image(width, height)

           # allocate some colors
           black = img.colorAllocate(0,   0,   0);
           red   = img.colorAllocate(255, 0,   0);
           blue  = img.colorAllocate(0,   0, 255);

           # draw a blue oval
           img.arc(50, 50, 95, 75, 0, 360, blue);

           # fill it with red
           img.fill(50, 50, red);

           # output binary image in PNG format
           img.png | redirect('example.png');
        %]

DESCRIPTION
    The Template-GD distribution provides a number of Template Toolkit
    plugin modules to interface with Lincoln Stein's GD modules. These in
    turn provide an interface to Thomas Boutell's GD graphics library.

    These plugins were distributed as part of the Template Toolkit until
    version 2.15 released in February 2006. At this time they were extracted
    into this separate distribution.

    For general information on the Template Toolkit see the documentation
    for the Template module or <http://template-toolkit.org>. For
    information on using plugins, see Template::Plugins and "USE" in
    Template::Manual::Directives.

METHODS
    The GD plugin module provides a number of methods to create various
    other GD objects. But first you need to load the GD plugin.

        [% USE GD %]

    Then you can call the following objects against it.

  image(width, height)
    Creates a new GD::Image object.

        [% image = GD.image(100, 200) %]

  polygon()
    Creates a new GD::Polygon object.

        [% poly = GD.polygon;
           poly.addPt(50,0);
           poly.addPt(99,99);
           poly.addPt(0,99);
           image.filledPolygon(poly, blue);
        %]

  text()
    Creates a new GD::Text object.

        [%  text = GD.text;
            text.set_text('Some text');
        %]
